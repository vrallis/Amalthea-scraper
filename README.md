# Amalthea-scraper
This is a command line script that opens multiple session requests for all courses located within a moodle platform called amalthea. I got help from Chat-GPT with fixing a few bits and pieces.


This program runs on the **command line** of windows. A **UI** for the app is planned to be implemented sometime in the future.

May get **flagged** by Windows Defender!
